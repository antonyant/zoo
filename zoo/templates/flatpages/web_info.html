3) Django Web Framework
why are our websites so good? Because we use some of the best technology there is: a web framework called Django.

"Django is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design."

Python is a programming language that is used for many serious pursuits, such as scientific research and engineering as well as web development*. It is also used for very large, famous and robust websites such as Google, NASA and YouTube.

Django is simply more secure

Security is a very serious issue on the internet.

The framework adheres to strict and long-standing software engineering concepts which massively decrease any security risks.

The way the system is designed mean that the security is excellent - much more so than nearly all the other system out there.
